## A Leap Of Faith ðŸŽ“ðŸ‘€

> Jumping into the unknown felt better than taking the beaten path.

In 2016, I dropped out of a Genetics & Biotech degree to join a startup running and analyzing social media ads.

Since then, I've been lucky enough to:
- Learn JavaScript, React, Python, and SQL through freeCodeCamp's certifications, Codecademy's curriculum, and Kaggle's 30 Days Of ML.
- Use those languages to make smarter, faster business decisions.
- Thrive in uncertain, fast-paced startup environments.
- Build fun projects and pivot toward a fulfilling, full-time career in software.

Lately, I camp, hike, and make Bob Belcher's punny burgers in my free time. Made a "Baby You Can 'Chive' My Car" Burger and it was \*chef's kiss\* delicious ðŸ¤Œ
