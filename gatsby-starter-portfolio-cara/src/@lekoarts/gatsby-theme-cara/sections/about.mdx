## A Leap Of Faith ðŸŽ“ðŸ‘€

> Jumping into the unknown felt better than taking the beaten path.

In 2016, I dropped out of a Genetics & Biotech degree with stable prospects to join a startup running social media ads.

Since then, I've been lucky enough to:
- Learn JavaScript, React, Python, and SQL through freeCodeCamp's certifications, Codecademy's curriculum, and Kaggle's 30 Days Of ML.
- Use those languages to make smarter, faster business decisions.
- Thrive in uncertain, fast-paced startup environments 
- Adjust to being solutions-focused when dealing with ambiguous problems.
- Present and explain technical solutions for business problems to clients.
- Work with rapidly changing software to drive a "bigger-picture" goal or vision.

What I'd like to do more of:
- Code, code, code.
- Learn enough to be dangerous knowing it's tough to know it all.
- Write software that's fast, gets shipped, and adds value.
- Dive into fullstack React & TypeScript development.
- Make cool things and solve technical problems all day. 
- Can't imagine a better job and can't wait to join your team (maybe, if you like me and I know enough).

Interested in learning:
- MERNG
- Django
- Flask
